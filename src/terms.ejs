                                form of any class or representative proceeding. If this paragraph is held unenforceable,
                                then the entirety of this Section 11.2 will be deemed void.<br><br>11.3. <strong>Jurisdiction
                                    and Venue</strong>. If Section 11.2 is deemed void or is otherwise inapplicable, all
                                disputes under these Terms will be resolved by a court of competent jurisdiction located
                                in Nantes, France, provided that the courts in any relevant venue will have jurisdiction
                                for the purposes of obtaining and enforcing injunctive or other equitable
                                relief.<br><br>11.4. <strong>Force Majeure</strong>. Neither party shall be liable for
                                delay or failure in performance (other than the making of payments) resulting from any
                                cause beyond the reasonable control of such party, including but not limited to, acts of
                                God, acts of war, riot, fire, flood, or other disaster, acts of government, strike
                                lockout, power failures, or the inability to use or the failure of any third party
                                telecommunications carrier or other services, which events or conditions prevent in
                                whole or in part the performance by such party of its obligations hereunder or which
                                renders the performance of such obligations so difficult or costly as to make
                                performance commercially unreasonable.<br><br>11.5. <strong>Assignment</strong>. You may
                                not assign any of your rights or obligations under these Terms without our prior written

                                <strong>Severability</strong>. The provisions of these Terms are severable. If any
                                individual provision is held to be invalid, unenforceable or contrary to applicable law,
                                such provision shall be construed, limited, altered or deleted, as necessary, to
                                eliminate the invalidity, unenforceability or conflict with applicable law while
                                endeavoring to preserve the intention of these Terms, and all other provisions shall
